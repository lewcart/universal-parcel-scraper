# ID Express

ID Express parcels use enabled universal providers. There is no dedicated adapter.

## Numbers

ID Express waybills are `ID`, a letter and twelve or thirteen digits; complaints, ID Express's
own replies and lookups on its tracker show the `IDE`, `IDM`, `IDP`, `IDS` and `IDV` prefixes,
`IDV` for a return. Rule `idexpress-1` claims the layout with high confidence because no other
carrier prints it. The tracker also takes Tokopedia order numbers starting `TKP8` and Tokopedia
booking codes starting `TKP01-`, which other couriers on Tokopedia track too, so no rule claims
them.

## Links

ID Express's site sends a search to `www.idexpress.com/lacak-paket?waybillNo={number}`, which
takes several numbers separated by commas; the library reads the number from that address.

## Testing

Provider live-test inputs and commands are in the
[provider READMEs](../../providers/README.md).
