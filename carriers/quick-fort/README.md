# Quick Fort

Quick Fort (速丰捷运国际物流有限公司) is a Hong Kong forwarder that carries express, air and road
freight between mainland China, Hong Kong and abroad. Its site is www.quick-fort.com.

## Retrieval

One `direct` GET asks the tracker's order page, `/search_kuai_di/search/orderid/<number>` on
www.quick-fort.com, as the site's search does; no key, cookie, session or browser is needed. It
names Chinese as its language: the site answers HTTP 500 to a language it cannot read, such as
Node's default `*`. The page holds the order's rows, newest first, each with a date and a
sentence, and names the number only in its search field, which the adapter checks.

A number the tracker does not hold gets the site's notice that no order was found
(`未查询到对应订单`), with HTTP 200; that notice is the only not-found. Another notice, a block
page and a changed page keep their failure kinds.

## Notes

- The rows relay the carrying network's scans in French. They have no codes, so the shared
  classifier reads each sentence, and an unread one leaves the row without a stage.
- Every row is on the tracker's own Hong Kong clock, wherever the scan was: 17TRACK dates the same
  rows on that clock, and a departure from Toronto then falls at night there.
- Some rows write a place before or after the sentence, with a region or country code and a
  postcode. The adapter takes it out of the sentence and keeps its names and codes as the row's
  place, without the postcode.

## Numbers

The one parcel the app has seen carries QFT and twelve digits, and 17TRACK filed its whole
history under Quick Fort. No public number has been found, so `quick-fort-1` has low confidence
and the corpus holds a synthetic one. The tracker takes any number of letters and digits, so the
adapter sends one of 6 to 40.

## Links

Tracking links carry the number in the path of the order page.

## Testing

`npm run test:carriers:live -- carriers/quick-fort`, with `QUICK_FORT_TRACKING_NUMBER` and
optionally `QUICK_FORT_UNKNOWN_NUMBER` set outside the repository.
