# United Delivery Service

United Delivery Service (UDS) is a regional courier for same-day, next-day and routed
deliveries in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin, sorted at its Chicago-area hubs. Tracked through
its tracker's page for a barcode.

## How it works

1. `direct`: one `GET https://www.uniteddeliveryservice.com/track/barcode/{number}`, the page
   the tracking form opens. The tracker renders it on the server: the status, the barcode, a
   rail of four steps of which only the current one has a place and a clock, a delivery
   estimate, the parcel's weight and size, and the proof of delivery. It needs no cookie,
   token, CAPTCHA or browser.
2. `retry`: one more try after a lookup that fails to connect or hangs. The first try gets half
   of the budget.

- A barcode the tracker does not hold gets "Barcode Not Found" and a notice naming the number,
  which is the only missing parcel. The tracker drops parcels after 30 to 90 days, by its own
  pages, so an older parcel is not found either. A redirect, a 404, a page without the status
  and a page for another number are no answer. Block pages are challenges, and rate limits and
  other HTTP errors keep their own failure kinds.
- The page must show the barcode asked.
- Recognition makes the same request.

## Notes

- The rail's earlier steps have no clock, so the result is the current step's scan alone and is
  marked `summary_only`, for a provider with a fuller history.
- A scan's clock is Chicago wall time to the second, named `CDT` or `CST`. It becomes an
  instant only when that name is Chicago's offset at that wall clock, which also tells the
  repeated autumn hour apart; any other clock stays `local_time`.
- The estimate reads like "Wed, Apr 1 by 8:00 PM", without a year. The day takes the one year
  near the lookup, within 45 days of it, on which it falls on that weekday; otherwise there is
  no estimate. The latest clock is not kept.
- The status heading stages the parcel before the step: it can name a delay, Will-Call or a
  return that the rail does not show. Wording the map does not know goes to the shared wording
  rules.
- The weight in pounds becomes kilograms; the size stays as shown, in inches.
- Where the parcel was left, the signature requirement, the delivery photo behind a ZIP code
  check, the delivery id and the issue form are not kept.
- The tracker has other lookups: `/track/api/isbarcode/{number}` says whether it holds a
  barcode, and `/track/api/orderref/{reference}` and `/track/api/deliveryNumber/{number}` look
  up shippers' references. The embeddable widget, `/track/include/extTracking.min.js`, reads
  `/track/api/barcode/{number}`, which answers with the former page's table of dated events
  and the destination's ZIP code. UDS also has an Android app. The adapter uses none of them.

## Limitations

- No history before the current step.
- The page shows the barcode as typed, so the check cannot tell whether the tracker matched the
  whole number.

## Numbers

The tracker takes the package barcode, which is often the shipper's own. UDS's own labels
carry two digits, `UDS` and eleven digits, or `APUDS` and eight digits;
`united-delivery-service-1` claims those layouts, which no other carrier uses. Other packages
keep the shipper's barcode: eleven, twelve or eighteen digits, `EZ` numbers from a shipping
platform, or references such as `BBC`, `DY` or `C` followed by digits. They name the shipper
or platform rather than UDS, or share their shape with many carriers, so no rule claims them.
A number filed under UDS reaches the adapter, which takes ten to forty letters and digits. The
samples and their sources are in [`numbers.json`](numbers.json).

## Links

Tracker pages are `uniteddeliveryservice.com/track/barcode/{number}`; the library reads the
number from that address.

## Testing

`npm run test:carriers:live -- carriers/united-delivery-service`, with
`UNITED_DELIVERY_SERVICE_TRACKING_NUMBER` and optionally
`UNITED_DELIVERY_SERVICE_UNKNOWN_NUMBER` set outside the repository.
